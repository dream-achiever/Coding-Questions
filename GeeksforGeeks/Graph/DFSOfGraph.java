/*
Given a connected undirected graph. Perform a Depth First Traversal of the graph.
Note: Use recursive approach to find the DFS traversal of the graph starting from the 0th vertex from left to right according to the graph..


Example 1:

Input:

Output: 0 1 2 4 3
Explanation: 
0 is connected to 1, 2, 4.
1 is connected to 0.
2 is connected to 0.
3 is connected to 0.
4 is connected to 0, 3.
so starting from 0, it will go to 1 then 2
then 4, and then from 4 to 3.
Thus dfs will be 0 1 2 4 3.
Example 2:

Input:

Output: 0 1 2 3
Explanation:
0 is connected to 1 , 3.
1 is connected to 2. 
2 is connected to 1.
3 is connected to 0. 
so starting from 0, it will go to 1 then 2
then back to 0 then 0 to 3
thus dfs will be 0 1 2 3. 

Your task:
You don’t need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function dfsOfGraph() which takes the integer V denoting the number of vertices and adjacency list as input parameters and returns  a list containing the DFS traversal of the graph starting from the 0th vertex from left to right according to the graph.


Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(V)


Constraints:
1 ≤ V, E ≤ 104
