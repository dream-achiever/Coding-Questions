/*
Given an array A of N positive numbers. The task is to find the position where equilibrium first occurs in the array. Equilibrium position in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. Then in the next line are N space separated values of the array A.

Output:
For each test case in a new  line print the position at which the elements are at equilibrium if no equilibrium point exists print -1.
Note: The output should be based on 1-based indexing, i.e. if the equilibrium point occurs at 1st position then output would be 1.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function equilibriumPoint() which returns the point of equilibrium.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= Ai <= 108

Example:
Input:
2
1
1
5
1 3 5 2 2

Output:
1
3

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Since its the only element hence its the only equilibrium point.
Testcase 2: For second test case equilibrium point is at position 3 as elements below it (1+3) = elements after it (2+2).
